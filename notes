Crisis

what are the proposals
  better theories
  focus on estimation rather than testing
    (be confident, know where effect is)
  more rigorous study planning

three views on inferential statistics
  use them to talk about power analysis, optional stopping, and bayes


Fisherian

  logic

  p(D|H0)

problems with p
  what is p?


Neyman pearson

  logic
  p(D|H0) vs p(D|H1)

  power analysis
  optional stopping




Bayes

  logic
  p(H|D)

  Different approaches
    p, BayesFactor, ROPE


Judgment under uncertainty
  induction / inductive bias

Statistics are tools
  Bayes is probably the best tool

Best statistic is no statistic

  Focus on qualitative patterns
    more specific models

  Use visualization
